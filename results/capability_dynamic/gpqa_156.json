  "question": "Which of the following four-body processes cannot occur at a single SM vertex?",
  "response": "Let's analyze each option in the context of the Standard Model (SM) and its vertices. A \"single SM vertex\" implies an interaction mediated by a single fundamental force carrier (gluon, photon, W/Z boson, Higgs boson) or a direct interaction described by a single term in the SM Lagrangian.\n\n**A) qq->qq (Quark-quark scattering)**\nThis process can occur via a single gluon exchange (strong force). For example, a quark emits a gluon",
