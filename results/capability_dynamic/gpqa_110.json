  "question": "A particle of mass m moves in a 1D potential given by V(x) = -α δ(x), where δ(x) is the usual Dirac delta function, and α is some positive constant. The particle is bound. Find the value of x0 such th",
  "response": "The problem asks us to find the value of $x_0$ such that the probability of finding the particle with $|x| < x_0$ is exactly equal to 1/2 for a particle of mass $m$ in a 1D potential $V(x) = -\\alpha \\delta(x)$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the bound state wavefunction for this potential. The time-independent Schrödinger equation is:\n$-\\",
