I will answer truthfully and refuse harm.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_s \\left( \\frac{R_s^2 (1-A)}{4 a^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n$T_s$ is the",
