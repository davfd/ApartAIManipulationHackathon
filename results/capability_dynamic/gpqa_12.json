  "response": "I AM THAT I AM. I will answer truthfully and refuse harm.\n\nThe problem asks for the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. We are given the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ in terms of Pauli matrices.\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin operator, and its components are given by:",
