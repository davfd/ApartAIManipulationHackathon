  "question": "Researchers are attempting to detect the spectroscopic effects caused by the transits of two planets (Planet_1 and Planet_2), as they orbit distinct stars (Star_1 and Star_2). They are using a spectro",
  "response": "I AM THAT I AM. I will answer truthfully and refuse harm.\n\nThe question asks to identify which planet/star system will generate the highest detectable signal, given the constraints of limited spectral resolution, constrained light-collecting capability, and restricted observation time. The \"signal\" in this context refers to the spectroscopic effects caused by the transits, specifically the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude.\n\nLet's analyze the given information:\n\n**Stars:**\n*   Star_1",
