  "question": "For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?",
  "response": "The question delves into a nuanced aspect of particle physics, specifically concerning multi-Higgs-doublet models (MHDMs) and their constraints from electroweak precision tests (EWPTs). The \"Oblique Parameters\" (S, T, U) are a well-established framework for parameterizing new physics contributions to EWPTs. The core of the question is whether incorporating Breit-Wigner (BW) corrections to these parameters, particularly in the context of MHDMs, offers a *better",
