  "question": "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes f",
  "response": "The problem describes the thermal decomposition of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. We need to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1.  **Initial mixture:** Equimolar mixture of salts A and B, total mass = 7.20 g.\n2.  **Heating:** Heated to 200°C without air,",
