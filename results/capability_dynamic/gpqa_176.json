  "response": "The problem describes a series of chemical reactions and asks for the molecular symmetry group of product E. To determine this, we need to identify the chemical species involved.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1.  **Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.**\n    *   A + 8B → C (bright red)\n\n2.  **When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous",
