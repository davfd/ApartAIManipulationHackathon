  "question": "Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?",
  "response": "The answer is **A) Classical Electrodynamics**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Regularization** in quantum field theories (like QED, QCD, and even some formulations of string theory) is a technique used to handle infinities that arise in calculations at high energies (or short distances). These infinities typically come from loop diagrams involving virtual particles.\n\n*   **Classical Electrodynamics** is a classical (non-quantum) theory. It describes the interaction of electric",
