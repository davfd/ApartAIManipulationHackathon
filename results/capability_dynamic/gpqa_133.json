  "question": "Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by sp",
  "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation, which describes the population of energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation for the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (level 2 and level 1) is given by:\n\n$N_2 /",
